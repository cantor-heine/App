/// children (those with null values for top, right, bottom, and left) are
/// laid out and initially placed in the upper-left corner of the stack. The
/// stack is then sized to enclose all of the non-positioned children. If there
/// are no non-positioned children, the stack becomes as large as possible.
///
/// The final location of non-positioned children is determined by the alignment
/// parameter. The left of each non-positioned child becomes the
/// difference between the child's width and the stack's width scaled by
/// alignment.x. The top of each non-positioned child is computed
/// similarly and scaled by alignment.y. So if the alignment x and y properties
/// are 0.0 (the default) then the non-positioned children remain in the
/// upper-left corner. If the alignment x and y properties are 0.5 then the
/// non-positioned children are centered within the stack.
///
/// Next, the positioned children are laid out. If a child has top and bottom
/// values that are both non-null, the child is given a fixed height determined
/// by subtracting the sum of the top and bottom values from the height of the stack.
/// Similarly, if the child has right and left values that are both non-null,
/// the child is given a fixed width derived from the stack's width.
/// Otherwise, the child is given unbounded constraints in the non-fixed dimensions.
///
/// Once the child is laid out, the stack positions the child
/// according to the top, right, bottom, and left properties of their
/// [StackParentData]. For example, if the bottom value is 10.0, the
/// bottom edge of the child will be inset 10.0 pixels from the bottom
/// edge of the stack. If the child extends beyond the bounds of the
/// stack, the stack will clip the child's painting to the bounds of
